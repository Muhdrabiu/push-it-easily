    <h1><a href="phone.html">Big Idea</a></h1>
    <p> It has been a customary perception that peace-loving people triumph more in life.
        Few realize that this is the very idea that acts as a barrier to realizing and
        identifying indispensable provisions to thrive in the challenges of day-to-day
        living.</p>
    <p>Day after day, you will be faced with numerous conflicts that demand the need to
        engage in constant struggle or battle. Bestselling author Robert Greene shares

        life.</p>

    <p>The mind indeed is so powerful that it can propel anything to action. A mind
        that is too emotional and clouded by past resentments may not see the world
        clearly and generate inappropriate strategies.</p>
    <h3>
        <p>1 - Declare War On Your Enemies: The Polarity Strategy</p>
    </h3>
    <p> Struggle is indeed an inevitable part of life. Enemies come everywhere,
        sometimes explicitly but more often than not, subtly. It is important that you
        recognize these enemies and from there, start strategizing.</p>
    <p> Yet again, everything starts from within. You should face the world with an open
        anticipation of this battle. It is your responsibility to program yourself to be in
        battle mode most of the time. Otherwise, you may easily be overpowered and
        end up a loser.</p>
    Discovering that you have too many enemies may entice you towards the safer
    side; which is to act in accordance to the enemies’ ways and be one of them.
    You should prevent this from happening or else, you will lose your identity.
    A magnet best demonstrates the polarity strategy. Opposite poles create
    movement. Consider your enemies as your opposites. Without enemies, you
    might lose your drive to go on with life.

    <p>Some people linger so much on the successes of the past, thinking that any
        change will hamper luck’s persistence. There is nothing wrong in celebrating
        past achievements. However, having a notion that previously effective strategies
        are perpetually the best is not at all beneficial.</p>
    <p>A mind that is locked up in the past gets a blurred version of reality. The past
        may be a good teacher but it should not be the focus and sole basis of all your
        thoughts and actions. Move forward and get hooked by present endeavors and
        their conditions.</p>
